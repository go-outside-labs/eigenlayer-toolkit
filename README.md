## ⛓🫱🏻‍🫲🏽 eigenlayer toolkit

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* [eigenlayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) is a protocol founded by [sreeram kannan, phd, professor of the university of washington](https://twitter.com/sreeramkannan), that has recently raised [$50 million at a $500 million evaluation series A round](https://www.theblock.co/post/208015/eigenlayer-series-a-round) to build a set of smart contracts allowing consensus layer stakers to opt in to validating new software modules on top of the ethereum ecosystem. in other words, validators assign their withdrawal keys so that it can slash them for malicious activity on the AVSs they choose to validate for.
* eigenlayer introduces two features aimed at extending eth's security to arbitrary systems and improving governance structures. these features are pooled security via restaking and free governance. users set their staking withdrawal address for their validators to point to eigenlayer's smart contracts.
* their first product is a data availability module called EigenDA ([here is mantle.xyz's eigenlayer txn](https://explorer.testnet.mantle.xyz/eigenda-batches?batch_index=2634&page_number=1&page_size=50&pages_limit=54))
